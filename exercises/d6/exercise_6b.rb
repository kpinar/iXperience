# 1. A request is an action performed by a client like a Browser or rest-client
# towards a Server to gain information about a webpage. It's made via a hypertext transfer protocol
#
# 2. A client makes the request such as Chrome, Firefox etc.
#
# 3. It goes to a server, which is usually a bunch of big black boxes stored in a warehouse
# It's on a hypertext transfer protocol. It's address is a domain name, a dns given by the ICAAP
#
# 4. It is approved by the server which sends back a response. Before that params are sent to
# an application which gives back an html page
#
# 5. An html page that is hopefully user friendly comes back that you can interact with.
#
# 6. Your browser interacts with it and makes it look like the page you see and further 
# communicates with it, that makes the website interactive.
